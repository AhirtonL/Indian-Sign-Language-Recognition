# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition
In this project, we aim towards analyzing and recognizing various alphabets from a database of sign images. Database consists of various images with each image clicked in different light condition with different hand orientation. With such a divergent data set, we are able to train our system to good levels and thus obtain good results.

We investigate different machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and a neural network technique Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) for detection of sign language.

The system is implemented in Python platform and trained using dataset of around 5000 images. The system is expandable for new dataset.
